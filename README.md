# ML-NLP-Project
Description

This project is intended to explore transformer-based model for bug-fixing process automation in software engineering. By leveraging datasets like Defects4J and ManySStuBs4J, we fine-tune a transformer model to autonomously identify and correct common programming errors.

Installation
To run this project, you need to install Python and the necessary libraries. The primary dependencies include Torch, Transformers and Pandas.
